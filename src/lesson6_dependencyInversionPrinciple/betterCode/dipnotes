Instead of depending in concrete class you should depend on abstrcation
highlevel module should not depend on low level modules but instead depend on abstrcation class

and it is done by dependency injestion and inversion stand here something ,
that you are not directly depend on something instead you are depending on abstract class,
 and other also depend on that abstact clss like both have common abstra.cation layer
